## Task Configuration Example üìù

```yaml
tasks:
  my_task:
    name: my_task
    schedule: "every_5min"  # or "daily 09:00"
    query:
      name: user_stats
      sql: |
        SELECT 
          date_trunc('day', created_at) as date,
          count(*) as total
        FROM users
        GROUP BY 1
```

- This tool executes SQL queries automatically. Users are responsible for validating their queries and ensuring they are safe to run.
- Users should thoroughly test their configurations before deploying to production environments.
- The authors are not responsible for any data loss, system damage, or other issues that may occur from using this tool.
- Always backup your data and test thoroughly before using in production.

### Data and Configuration Responsibility
- All configuration files are stored in `~/.goractor/`
  - `tasks.yaml`: Task definitions and schedules
  - `config.yaml`: Database connections
  - `destinations.yaml`: Destination settings (webhooks, tokens)
- **Users are solely responsible for:**
  - Backing up configuration files
  - Securing sensitive information (database credentials, API tokens)
  - Managing and transferring configurations between environments
  - Version controlling their configurations
  - Validating configurations before deployment

### Security Considerations
- Configuration files may contain sensitive information:
  - Database credentials
  - API tokens
  - Webhook URLs
- Users must ensure proper permissions and security measures
- Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for production deployments

### Execution and Data
- This tool executes SQL queries automatically
- Users are responsible for validating their queries and ensuring they are safe to run
- The authors are not responsible for:
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Leaked credentials or tokens
  - Lost or corrupted configuration files
  - System performance issues
  - Any damages resulting from automated execution

### Configuration Best Practices
```bash
# Directory structure
~/.goractor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.yaml      # BACKUP REQUIRED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml     # CONTAINS SENSITIVE DATA
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ destinations.yaml # CONTAINS SENSITIVE DATA

A robust PostgreSQL scheduling task manager that helps you automate SQL queries and deliver results to various destinations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Systemd (for Linux scheduling)

git clone https://github.com/ONCALLJP/goractor.git
cd goractor
go build -o goractor cmd/goractor/main.go
```

### Install using go install
```bash
go install github.com/ONCALLJP/goractor/cmd/goractor@latest
```

## Configuration Structure

All configurations are stored in `~/.goractor/`:
```
~/.goractor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml      # Database connections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.yaml       # Task definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ destinations.yaml # Destination settings
```

### Database Configuration
```bash
# Add new database connection
goractor config add
# List configured databases
goractor config list
```

Example config.yaml:
```yaml
databases:
  db1:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    user: postgres
    dbname: mydb
```

### Destination Configuration
```bash
# Add new destination
goractor destination add
# List configured destinations
goractor destination list
```

Example destinations.yaml:
```yaml
destinations:
  slack1:
    type: slack
    webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/...
    channel: monitoring
```

## Task Management

### Creating a Task
```bash
goractor task add
```

This will prompt for:
1. Task name
2. Database selection
3. SQL query
4. Schedule configuration
5. Destination selection
6. Output format (CSV/JSON)

Example tasks.yaml:
```yaml
tasks:
  daily_stats:
    name: daily_stats
    database: db1
    schedule: "daily 09:00"
    query:
      name: user_stats
      sql: |
        SELECT 
          date_trunc('day', created_at) as date,
          count(*) as total
        FROM users
        GROUP BY 1
    destination: slack1
    output_format: csv
```

### Schedule Types
- Every 5 minutes: `every_5min`
- Every hour: `every_hour`
- Daily at specific time: `daily HH:MM`
- Weekly on specific days: `weekly Mon,Wed,Fri HH:MM`
- Monthly on specific day: `monthly DD HH:MM`

### Managing Tasks
```bash
# List all tasks
goractor task list

# Test a task
goractor task test task1

# Remove a task
goractor task remove task1
```

## Scheduler Management

```bash
# Install task schedule
goractor systemd install task1

# Check status
goractor systemd status

# Restart task
goractor systemd restart task1

# Disable task
goractor systemd disable task1
```

## Debugging

```bash
# View task details and status
goractor debug task1

# View logs
goractor log show

# Clean logs
goractor log clean
```
